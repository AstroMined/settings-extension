# Documentation Standards

## Executive Summary

This document defines the documentation standards and organization for this project. We use a hybrid approach combining three complementary frameworks:

- **arc42** for architecture documentation
- **Diátaxis** for user-facing documentation
- **Developer Guides** for practical workflow documentation

This approach eliminates redundancy while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all documentation needs.

## Scope

- **Applies to**: All documentation in the `/docs` directory
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-03
- **Status**: Approved

## Framework Overview

### 1. arc42 (Architecture Documentation)

**Purpose**: Documents the system's design, structure, and architectural decisions.
**Location**: `/docs/architecture/`
**Answers**: "How is the system designed and why?"

arc42 provides a proven template for software architecture documentation with 11 sections covering everything from high-level goals to deployment details. We use this for all technical architecture documentation.

### 2. Diátaxis (User Documentation)

**Purpose**: Provides user-facing documentation in four distinct types.
**Location**: `/docs/user/`
**Answers**: "How do I use the system?"

Diátaxis categorizes documentation by user needs:

- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented guides for newcomers
- **How-to guides**: Task-oriented instructions for specific goals
- **Reference**: Information-oriented technical descriptions
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented conceptual discussion

### 3. Developer Guides (Workflow Documentation)

**Purpose**: Practical guides for developers working on the project.
**Location**: `/docs/developer/`
**Answers**: "How do I work on this project?"

This fills the gap between architecture (how it's built) and user docs (how to use it) by documenting the practical aspects of development work.

## Decision Criteria: What Goes Where?

### Architecture Documentation (arc42)

Place content here if it answers questions about:

- System design and structure
- Technology choices and rationale
- Component relationships and interfaces
- Quality attributes and how they're achieved
- Architectural patterns and principles
- Technical constraints and their impact

**Examples**:

- "Why did we choose microservices?"
- "How do components communicate?"
- "What are our performance requirements?"

### User Documentation (Diátaxis)

Place content here if it helps users:

- Learn the system (Tutorials)
- Accomplish specific tasks (How-to)
- Look up technical details (Reference)
- Understand concepts (Explanation)

**Examples**:

- "Getting started with the API"
- "How to configure authentication"
- "API endpoint reference"
- "Understanding our data model"

### Developer Guides

Place content here if it helps developers:

- Set up their environment
- Follow team processes
- Debug and troubleshoot
- Contribute effectively

**Examples**:

- "Setting up your IDE"
- "Running tests locally"
- "Debugging production issues"
- "Submitting a pull request"

## Document Templates

### Standard Document Structure

All documentation files should follow this template:

```markdown
# [Document Title]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence overview of what this document covers and why it matters]

## Scope

- **Applies to**: [List specific files/directories/modules]
- **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Draft/Review/Approved

## [Main Content Sections]

[Content organized with clear headers]

## References

- [Links to related documentation]
- [External resources]

## Revision History

| Date       | Author | Changes         |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Name   | Initial version |
```

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context

[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?]

## Decision

[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Documentation Duplication

❌ **DON'T**: Copy architectural details into developer guides
✅ **DO**: Link to the relevant architecture documentation

### 2. Wrong Location

❌ **DON'T**: Put debugging guides in architecture docs
✅ **DO**: Put debugging guides in developer/guides/

### 3. Mixed Audiences

❌ **DON'T**: Mix end-user and developer content
✅ **DO**: Clearly separate by audience in different directories

### 4. Orphaned Documentation

❌ **DON'T**: Create documentation without clear ownership
✅ **DO**: Assign maintainers and review schedules

## Cross-Referencing

Use relative links to connect related documentation:

```markdown
# In developer guide

For the architectural rationale behind our testing approach, see
[Storage Strategy Decision](architecture/09-architecture-decisions/003-storage-strategy.md)

# In architecture doc

For practical testing instructions, see
[Testing Guide](developer/workflows/testing-guide.md)
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New Documentation

1. **Determine the type**: Is it architecture, user, or developer focused?
2. **Check for existing content**: Avoid duplication
3. **Choose correct location**: Follow the decision criteria above
4. **Use appropriate template**: Maintain consistency
5. **Add navigation**: Update relevant README files
6. **Cross-reference**: Link to related documentation

### Documentation Review Process

1. Documentation changes reviewed with code changes
2. Technical accuracy verified by subject matter experts
3. Writing clarity checked for target audience
4. Links and references validated

## Maintenance Strategy

### Regular Reviews

- **Quarterly**: Review architecture documentation for accuracy
- **Monthly**: Update developer guides based on team feedback
- **With each release**: Update user documentation

### Freshness Indicators

Each document includes:

- Last updated date
- Status (Draft/Review/Approved)
- Revision history

### Automation

Where possible, automate:

- API documentation from OpenAPI specs
- Architecture diagrams from code
- Link validation
- Markdown linting

## Historical Context and Rationale

This documentation structure was designed to address common problems:

1. **Redundancy**: Traditional documentation often duplicates information across multiple documents, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance burden.

2. **Missing Developer Guides**: Both arc42 and Diátaxis excel in their domains but neither adequately addresses practical developer workflows.

3. **Unclear Organization**: Without clear boundaries, documentation tends to sprawl and become difficult to navigate.

4. **Mixed Audiences**: Technical architecture details mixed with end-user guides confuse both audiences.

Our solution leverages the strengths of established frameworks while adding a dedicated space for developer-focused content. This creates clear boundaries, eliminates duplication, and ensures comprehensive coverage.

@echo off
echo Exporting Settings Extension settings...
:: Script opens extension and exports settings
:: Copies to cloud folder with timestamp
echo Settings synced to cloud storage
pause
```

**macOS/Linux Shell Script Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Syncing Settings Extension..."
# Script to automate export and cloud upload
# Include error checking and logging
echo "Sync complete"
```

#### Schedule Automation

1. **Windows Task Scheduler**
   - Create daily task
   - Run sync script automatically
   - Log results for troubleshooting

2. **macOS/Linux Cron Jobs**
   - Add to crontab
   - Schedule daily/weekly runs
   - Include error handling

## Cross-Browser Sync

### Syncing Between Different Browsers

**Chrome ↔ Firefox ↔ Edge synchronization**

   - Use export/import for all browsers
   - Settings Extension uses same format across browsers
   - No conversion needed

2. **Cloud-Based Central Storage**
   - Single cloud folder for all browsers
   - Each browser exports to same location
   - Import latest from any browser

3. **Naming Convention**
   ```
   settings-chrome-laptop-2025-08-11.json
   settings-firefox-desktop-2025-08-11.json
   settings-edge-work-2025-08-11.json
   ```

#### Cross-Browser Sync Process

**Setup Phase:**

1. Install Settings Extension on all browsers
2. Configure cloud storage access
3. Create shared sync folder
4. Test export/import on each browser

**Regular Sync:**

1. Export from primary browser daily
2. Import to secondary browsers as needed
3. Keep one "master" configuration
4. Update all browsers from master

### Browser-Specific Considerations

**Chrome Specifics:**

- Native sync works well within Chrome ecosystem
- Easy to sync across Chrome installations
- Limited to Chrome family browsers

**Firefox Specifics:**

- Firefox sync less reliable for extension data
- Manual backup/restore recommended
- Works well with cloud storage approach

**Edge Specifics:**

settings-chrome-laptop-v1.0-2025-08-11.json
settings-firefox-desktop-v1.1-2025-08-11.json
settings-edge-work-v1.0-2025-08-11.json
```

**Folder Structure**

```
Settings Sync/
├── Current/           # Latest from each device
├── Master/           # Authoritative version
├── Archive/          # Historical backups
└── Devices/
    ├── Laptop/
    ├── Desktop/
    └── Mobile/
```

**Documentation**

- Maintain sync log with changes and dates
- Document device-specific customizations
- Record sync procedures for team members

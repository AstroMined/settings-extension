- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-11
- **Status**: Approved

## Security Overview

### Security Principles

The Settings Extension follows these core security principles:

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security protection
**Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access rights
**Data Minimization**: Collect and store only necessary data
**Transparency**: Clear information about what data is stored and how
**User Control**: Users maintain control over their data

### Threat Model

Understanding potential threats helps implement appropriate protections:

**Local Threats**:

- Unauthorized access to your device
- Malicious software on your computer
- Browser vulnerabilities
- Physical theft of devices

**Network Threats**:

- Man-in-the-middle attacks during sync
- Unsecured network connections
- DNS hijacking or spoofing
- Network traffic interception

**Service Threats**:

- Compromise of cloud sync services
- Unauthorized access to shared storage
- Data breaches at service providers
- Account takeover attacks

**Social Threats**:

- Accidental sharing of sensitive data
- Insider threats within teams
- Social engineering attacks
- Unintentional data exposure

## Data Storage Security

### Local Storage Protection

#### Browser Security Model

Modern browsers provide several security layers:

**Process Isolation**:

- Extensions run in isolated processes
- Settings data isolated from other extensions
- Protection from malicious websites
- Memory protection between processes

**Extension Sandboxing**:

- Limited file system access
- Restricted network permissions
- Controlled access to browser APIs
- Mandatory permission declarations

**Storage Encryption**:

- Browser storage encrypted at rest (varies by browser)
- Operating system level encryption
- User profile protection
- Secure deletion of data

#### Storage Location Security

**Chrome/Edge Storage**:

```
Windows: %LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Extension Settings\
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Extension Settings/
Linux: ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Local Extension Settings/
```

**Firefox Storage**:

```
Windows: %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile]\extension-data\
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/[profile]/extension-data/
Linux: ~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile]/extension-data/
```

**Protection Methods**:

- File system permissions restrict access
- Browser profile encryption (when enabled)
- Operating system user account separation
- Antivirus and anti-malware scanning

### Sync Storage Security

#### Browser Sync Security

**Chrome/Edge Sync**:

- Data encrypted in transit using TLS
- Data encrypted at rest on Google/Microsoft servers
- Account-based access control
- Two-factor authentication support

**Firefox Sync**:

- End-to-end encryption with client-generated keys
- Zero-knowledge architecture (Mozilla can't decrypt)
- Account password protects encryption keys
- Stronger privacy model than Chrome

#### Sync Security Considerations

**Account Security**:

- Strong passwords for browser sync accounts
- Two-factor authentication enabled
- Regular password updates
- Monitoring for unauthorized access

**Network Security**:

- Always use HTTPS connections
- Avoid public WiFi for sensitive sync operations
- Use VPN when syncing over untrusted networks
- Verify SSL/TLS certificates

## Sensitive Data Protection

### Identifying Sensitive Information

#### High-Risk Data Types

**Authentication Credentials**:

- API keys and tokens
- Passwords and passphrases
- Authentication certificates
- OAuth tokens and refresh tokens

**Personal Information**:

- Email addresses and usernames
- Phone numbers and addresses
- Social security or national ID numbers
- Personal identification details

**Business Information**:

- Company internal URLs and endpoints
- Proprietary configuration details
- Customer or client information
- Trade secrets or confidential processes

**Financial Information**:

- Credit card or payment details
- Banking information
- Financial account numbers
- Transaction details

#### Medium-Risk Data Types

**System Information**:

### Protecting Sensitive Data

#### Data Classification

**Public**: Safe to share with anyone

```json
{
  "feature_enabled": true,
  "refresh_interval": 60,
  "theme_preference": "dark"
}
```

**Internal**: Safe within organization

```json
{
  "company_api_endpoint": "https://internal-api.company.com",
  "corporate_styling": "/* Company CSS */",
  "team_workflow_settings": { "process": "agile" }
}
```

**Confidential**: Restricted access only

```json
{
  "api_key": "CONFIDENTIAL_DO_NOT_SHARE",
  "database_connection": "server=internal.db;user=secret",
  "encryption_keys": "HIGHLY_SENSITIVE"
}
```

**Secret**: Highest protection level

```json
{
  "master_api_key": "SECRET_MASTER_KEY",
  "root_credentials": "admin:supersecret",
  "encryption_master_key": "TOP_SECRET_KEY"
}
```

#### Data Sanitization

**Before Sharing Settings**:

1. **Remove Authentication Data**:

```json
// Original settings
{
  "api_key": "prod_1234567890abcdef",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com"
}

// Sanitized for sharing
{
  "api_key": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com"
}
```

2. **Replace Personal Information**:

```json
// Original settings
{
  "user_email": "john.smith@company.com",
  "custom_css": "/* John's personal styles */"
}

// Sanitized for sharing
{
  "user_email": "USER_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER",
  "custom_css": "/* Team standard styles */"
}
```

3. **Remove Internal References**:

```json
// Original settings
{
  "internal_endpoint": "https://dev-server-01.internal.company.com",
  "debug_path": "/Users/john/Development/project"
}

// Sanitized for sharing
{
  "internal_endpoint": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT",
  "debug_path": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LOCAL_PATH"
}
```

## Network Security

### Secure Communication

#### HTTPS Protection

**What HTTPS Provides**:

- Encryption of data in transit
- Authentication of server identity
- Protection against tampering
- Protection against eavesdropping

**HTTPS Best Practices**:

- Verify SSL/TLS certificates
- Use modern TLS versions (1.2 or higher)
- Avoid mixed content warnings
- Check for certificate chain validity

#### API Security

**Secure API Configuration**:

```json
{
  "advanced_config": {
    "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/v1", // Always use HTTPS
    "timeout": 10000,
    "retries": 3,
    "headers": {
      "User-Agent": "SettingsExtension/1.0",
      "Accept": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" // Secure authentication
    },
    "ssl_verify": true, // Verify SSL certificates
    "follow_redirects": false // Prevent redirect attacks
  }
}
```

**API Security Considerations**:

- Use API keys with limited scope and permissions
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use token-based authentication when possible

### Network Threat Mitigation

#### Man-in-the-Middle Protection

**Detection**:

- Certificate pinning where possible

- Enable browser security warnings

#### DNS Security

**DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**:

- Encrypts DNS queries
- Prevents DNS manipulation
- Protects against DNS hijacking
- Available in modern browsers

**DNS Configuration**:

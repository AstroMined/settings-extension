### Understanding Setting Types

Each setting has a specific type that determines how you interact with it:

- **Text**: Short text inputs with character limits
- **Long Text**: Large text areas for longer content
- **Number**: Numeric inputs with min/max validation
- **JSON**: Complex object configurations

## Step 4: Making Your First Changes

Let's modify a simple setting to get comfortable with the interface:

### Changing the Feature Toggle

1. **Locate "Feature Enabled"**
   - It should be the first setting in the list
   - Shows a toggle switch

## Step 5: Accessing Advanced Features

- **Time Required**: 5-10 minutes
- **Prerequisites**: Settings Extension installed and configured
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-11
- **Status**: Approved

## What You'll Learn

2. Export settings from the popup interface
3. Export settings from advanced options
4. Organize and name your backup files
5. Verify your backup was created successfully

## Step 1: Why Create Backups?

### Protection Against Data Loss

Settings backups protect you from:
- **Accidental changes**: Easily restore if you modify something incorrectly
- **Extension updates**: Preserve settings during version upgrades
- **Browser issues**: Restore settings after browser problems
- **Device changes**: Move settings to new computers
- **Shared configurations**: Share settings with team members

### When to Create Backups

Create backups:
- Before making major configuration changes
- Before browser or extension updates
- Weekly for important configurations
- Before switching devices
- When experimenting with new settings

## Step 2: Quick Export from Popup

The fastest way to create a backup is through the extension popup:

### Opening the Export Dialog

1. **Click the Settings Extension Icon**
   - The gear icon in your browser toolbar
   - The popup interface opens

2. **Locate the Export Button**
   - At the bottom of the popup
   - Shows a download arrow icon and "Export" text

*Screenshot placeholder: [Popup interface with Export button highlighted]*

3. **Click Export**
   - Click the "Export" button
   - A file download will begin immediately

### Understanding the Downloaded File

Your browser will download a file named:
```
settings-extension-backup-2025-08-11-14-30-25.json
```

**File name breakdown:**
- `settings-extension-backup`: Identifies the file type
- `2025-08-11`: Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `14-30-25`: Time (HH-MM-SS format)
- `.json`: File extension

### File Location

The file downloads to your browser's default download location:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[YourName]\Downloads\`
- **macOS**: `/Users/[YourName]/Downloads/`
- **Linux**: `/home/[yourname]/Downloads/`

## Step 3: Advanced Export Options

For more control over your backup, use the advanced settings page:

### Opening Advanced Settings

1. **Click the Gear Icon**
   - In the top-right of the popup
   - Opens advanced settings in a new tab

2. **Navigate to Import/Export**
   - Click "Import/Export" in the left sidebar
   - The backup tools appear in the main area

### Using the Advanced Export

1. **Locate the Export Section**
   - "Export Settings" card at the top
   - Contains description and export button

2. **Read the Description**
   - "Download your current settings as a JSON file for backup or sharing"
   - Explains what the export contains

3. **Click "Export Settings"**
   - Large blue button with download icon
   - File download begins immediately

### Advantages of Advanced Export

The advanced export offers:
- More visible interface for less experienced users
- Clear descriptions of what's being exported
- Better integration with other backup tools
- Access to additional backup options (future features)

## Step 4: Organizing Your Backups

### Creating a Backup Folder

1. **Create a Dedicated Folder**
   - Navigate to your Documents folder
   - Create a new folder: "Browser Extension Backups"
   - Create a subfolder: "Settings Extension"

2. **Move Your Backup File**
   - Cut the downloaded file from Downloads
   - Paste it into your backup folder

### Naming Best Practices

Consider renaming your backups with descriptive names:

**Before major changes:**
```
settings-backup-before-api-update-2025-08-11.json
```

**Regular weekly backups:**
```
settings-weekly-backup-2025-week-32.json
```

**Configuration snapshots:**
```
settings-production-config-2025-08-11.json
```

**Project-specific:**
```
settings-project-alpha-config-2025-08-11.json
```

## Step 5: Verifying Your Backup

It's important to verify your backup was created successfully:

### Check File Properties

1. **Right-click the backup file**
2. **Select "Properties" (Windows) or "Get Info" (macOS)**
3. **Verify the details:**
   - File size should be reasonable (typically 1-10 KB)
   - Created date should match when you exported
   - File type should be JSON

### Preview the Contents

1. **Open the file in a text editor**
   - Right-click → "Open with" → Notepad/TextEdit
   - Or drag the file to your preferred text editor

2. **Verify the structure:**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "timestamp": "2025-08-11T14:30:25.123Z",
     "settings": {
       "feature_enabled": {
         "type": "boolean",
         "value": true,
         "description": "Enable main feature functionality"
       },
       // ... more settings
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check for your settings:**
   - Look for settings you've modified
   - Verify values match your current configuration
   - Ensure all settings are present

### Test Import (Optional)

For extra confidence, test that your backup works:

1. **Make a minor setting change**
2. **Import your backup file** (see [Import Guide](../how-to/export-import.md))
3. **Verify the setting reverts to the backup value**

## Step 6: Backup Best Practices

### Regular Backup Schedule

Establish a routine:
- **Daily**: If you frequently modify settings
- **Weekly**: For most users with stable configurations  
- **Before changes**: Always backup before major modifications
- **Before updates**: Backup before browser or extension updates

### Multiple Backup Locations

Store backups in multiple places:
- **Local folder**: Quick access on your computer
- **Cloud storage**: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox
- **Network drive**: Company shared storage (if allowed)
- **USB drive**: Offline backup for critical configurations

### Backup Retention

Keep backups organized:
- Keep daily backups for 1 week
- Keep weekly backups for 1 month  
- Keep monthly backups for 1 year
- Keep yearly backups indefinitely

## Common Backup Issues

### Download Doesn't Start
**Problem**: Clicking Export doesn't download a file
**Solutions**:
- Check if downloads are blocked in your browser
- Try refreshing the page and exporting again
- Check browser download permissions

### File Size is Too Small
**Problem**: Backup file is only a few bytes
**Possible causes**:
- Settings may not be loaded properly
- Try refreshing and exporting again
- Verify settings show properly in the interface

### Can't Find Downloaded File
**Problem**: Export seems to work but can't find the file
**Solutions**:
- Check your browser's download history (Ctrl+J)
- Look in the default Downloads folder
- Search your computer for "settings-extension-backup"

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Information

Your backup may contain:
- API keys and tokens
- Custom CSS with company branding
- Configuration data specific to your organization

### Safe Storage

- Don't share backup files unless necessary
- Use secure cloud storage with encryption
- Keep backups private and protected
- Consider password-protecting sensitive backups

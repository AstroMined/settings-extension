## Key Cross-Reference Patterns

### Bidirectional References

These document pairs reference each other for comprehensive coverage:

1. **Architecture Goals ↔ User Experience**
   - [Architecture Goals](architecture/01-introduction-goals.md) ↔ [Core Concepts](user/explanation/concepts.md)
   - System requirements explained from both technical and user perspectives

2. **Component Design ↔ API Reference**
   - [Building Blocks](architecture/05-building-blocks.md) ↔ [Settings Types](user/reference/settings-types.md)
   - Technical design and user-facing API maintain consistency

3. **Quality Requirements ↔ Performance Guides**
   - [Quality Requirements](architecture/10-quality-requirements.md) ↔ [Performance Profiling](developer/guides/performance-profiling.md)
   - Architectural promises and measurement techniques

4. **Security Design ↔ User Privacy**
   - [Crosscutting Concepts](architecture/08-crosscutting-concepts.md) ↔ [Security & Privacy](user/explanation/security.md)
   - Technical implementation and user-facing implications

### Hierarchical References

Information flows from high-level to specific:

1. **Requirements → Implementation → Validation**
   - [Architecture Goals](architecture/01-introduction-goals.md) → [Extension Development](developer/guides/extension-development.md) → [Testing Guide](developer/workflows/testing-guide.md)

2. **System Design → User Interface → User Guides**
   - [Building Blocks](architecture/05-building-blocks.md) → [Settings Types](user/reference/settings-types.md) → [Getting Started](user/tutorials/getting-started.md)

3. **Technical Decisions → Development Standards → Implementation**
   - [Architecture Decisions](architecture/09-architecture-decisions/) → [Coding Standards](developer/conventions/coding-standards.md) → [Local Setup](developer/workflows/local-setup.md)

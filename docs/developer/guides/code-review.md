## Review Guidelines for Reviewers

### Review Approach

#### Code Reading Strategy

1. **High-Level Understanding**
   - Read PR description and linked issues
   - Understand the problem being solved
   - Review architectural approach

2. **Detailed Code Review**
   - Review each file and change
   - Look for patterns and consistency
   - Check for potential issues

3. **Integration Review**
   - Consider impact on existing code
   - Check for breaking changes
   - Verify compatibility requirements

### Feedback Guidelines

#### Constructive Feedback

- Be specific about issues and provide examples
- Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems
- Explain reasoning behind feedback
- Use "we" language to foster collaboration
- Focus on the code, not the person

#### Feedback Categories

Use these prefixes to categorize feedback:

- **Must Fix**: Critical issues that block merge
- **Should Fix**: Important issues that should be addressed
- **Consider**: Suggestions for improvement
- **Question**: Requests for clarification
- **Praise**: Positive feedback on good practices

#### Example Feedback

**Good Feedback:**

```
Must Fix: This function doesn't handle the case where `settings` is null.
Consider adding a null check at the beginning of the function:

if (!settings) {
  throw new Error('Settings parameter is required');
}
```

**Poor Feedback:**

```
This is wrong.
```

### Review Best Practices

#### For Reviewers

- Review code promptly within target timelines
- Provide actionable feedback with specific suggestions
- Test critical changes locally when possible
- Ask questions if something is unclear
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements

#### For Authors

- Respond to all feedback, even if just to acknowledge
- Ask for clarification on unclear feedback
- Make requested changes or explain why you disagree
- Update documentation and tests based on feedback
- Thank reviewers for their time and input

# Component Interactions Diagram

## Executive Summary

This diagram will provide a detailed C4 Model Level 3 view of the Settings Extension components, showing the internal structure, responsibilities, and interaction patterns between all major system components. It will illustrate how components collaborate to deliver the extension's functionality.

## Scope

- **Applies to**: Internal component architecture and detailed interaction patterns
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-13
- **Status**: Draft (Placeholder - Content pending)

## Planned Content

This placeholder file will be developed into a comprehensive component interactions diagram covering:

### Core Component Structure

- Service Worker (`background.js`) - Central coordinator and message router
- Settings Manager (`lib/settings-manager.js`) - Core business logic and validation
- Browser Compatibility Layer (`lib/browser-compat.js`) - Cross-browser API abstraction
- Content Settings API (`lib/content-settings.js`) - Web page integration interface
- Storage Manager - Data persistence and synchronization

### User Interface Components

- Popup Interface (`popup/popup.js`) - Quick access UI component
- Options Page - Advanced configuration interface
- Settings Form Components - Reusable form elements
- Notification System - User feedback mechanisms
- Import/Export Components - Backup and restore functionality

### Internal Communication Patterns

- Message passing between service worker and UI components
- Event-driven architecture for settings changes
- Data flow between storage and business logic layers
- Error propagation and handling chains
- State management across components

### External Integration Points

- Browser API adapters and wrappers
- Content script injection and communication
- Web application API surface
- Storage service interfaces
- Extension lifecycle event handlers

## Diagram Types to Include

- Cache invalidation propagation
- Event notification distribution

## Technical Details to Cover

### Component Responsibilities

#### Service Worker Components

- **Message Router**: Routes messages between UI and content scripts
- **Settings Controller**: Orchestrates settings operations
- **Storage Coordinator**: Manages data persistence strategies
- **Event Dispatcher**: Handles and propagates system events
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Manages extension initialization and cleanup

#### UI Components

- **Popup Controller**: Manages popup interface state and interactions
- **Options Controller**: Handles advanced configuration interface
- **Form Validators**: Validates user input across UI components
- **Theme Manager**: Manages UI theming and appearance
- **Notification Controller**: Displays user feedback and messages

#### Integration Components

- **Content Script Manager**: Handles content script injection and communication
- **API Gateway**: Provides unified interface for web application integration
- **Storage Adapter**: Abstracts browser storage implementations
- **Compatibility Manager**: Handles browser-specific implementations
- **Error Handler**: Centralizes error handling and logging

### Interaction Patterns

#### Synchronous Interactions

- Direct method calls within same execution context
- Synchronous validation operations
- Immediate state updates and UI refreshes
- Cache lookups and simple data retrievals

#### Asynchronous Interactions

- Message passing between isolated contexts
- Storage operations and data persistence
- Cross-browser API calls through compatibility layer
- Network operations and synchronization

#### Event-Driven Interactions

- Settings change notifications
- Storage synchronization events
- User interface state updates
- Error propagation and handling
- Lifecycle event broadcasting

## Component Interface Definitions

### Internal APIs

When completed, will document:

- Settings Manager API surface
- Storage Manager interface contracts
- UI Component communication protocols
- Event system message formats
- Error handling interface specifications

### External APIs

- Content Script API for web applications
- Browser API wrapper interfaces
- Storage provider abstractions
- Extension lifecycle event handlers
- Third-party integration points

## Quality Requirements

### Performance Goals

- Component initialization: < 100ms total
- Inter-component message passing: < 10ms
- UI component rendering: < 200ms
- Settings operation coordination: < 150ms

### Reliability Goals

- Component failure isolation and recovery
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable
- State consistency across component boundaries
- Error propagation without system failure

### Maintainability Goals

- Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Minimal coupling between components
- Consistent interface patterns
- Comprehensive component documentation

## Development Timeline

- **Priority**: High - Essential for understanding system architecture
- **Estimated Development**: 4-5 days
- **Dependencies**: Complete analysis of component implementations
- **Delivery Target**: Next architecture documentation sprint

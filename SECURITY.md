## Common Security Concerns

### Data Storage
**Q: Where is my settings data stored?**
A: All settings are stored locally in your browser using the browser.storage.local API. No data is sent to external servers.

**Q: Can other extensions access my settings?**
A: No, each extension has its own isolated storage space that other extensions cannot access.

**Q: Are my settings encrypted?**
A: Browser storage provides built-in encryption and security. Additionally, we implement additional validation and sanitization.

### Permissions
**Q: Why does the extension need these permissions?**
A: We only request minimal necessary permissions:
- `storage`: To save and retrieve settings
- `activeTab`: To interact with content scripts when needed

**Q: Can the extension access my browsing history?**
A: No, we do not request or have access to browsing history or other sensitive browser data.

### Privacy
**Q: Do you collect any personal data?**
A: No, we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All settings remain local to your browser.

**Q: Are there any analytics or tracking?**
A: No, we do not include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry in the extension.

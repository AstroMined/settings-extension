- Place tests adjacent to implementation files

### Git Workflow

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable
- Use conventional commit format:

  ```
  type(scope): description

  Examples:
  feat(api): add settings export functionality
  fix(ui): resolve popup positioning issue
  docs(readme): update installation instructions
  ```

## üß™ Testing
